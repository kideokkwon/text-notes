This textbook was one of the first introductions to Causal Inference. During the time I was introduced to this text, my understanding of causal inference was minimal; For example, I knew that there existed something called "propensity score matching" and that it was very popular but also heard that there were criticisms for it. 

As you may expect, while I did extract plenty of useful information in my first run of the book, there were also a lot of details I missed. When reading a textbook for the first time, especially one that focuses deeply on breadth, it can be difficult to know which concepts to focus on more out of the dozens introduced. Subconciously (just based on my limited prior knowledge of causal inference), I had an overemphasis on concepts like DAGs (Ch.6) and Matching (Ch.15), which are extremely important topics and I am glad I learned them (which led to their own deep rabbit holes, especially with Matching), but I didn't focus really at all on other important topics such as g-formula, time-varying treatments, and marginal structural models (although to be fair, these 3 are all intrinsically linked). 

If you're familiar with those concepts, you'll notice that these concepts all happen to be what Robins (one of the authors of the book) is widely known for in the causal inference field. It's an interesting coincidence, my retrospective assumption is that I heard names like Pearl and Rubin more often which led me to study more of their work. It may have just been a matter of discipline - Pearl and Rubin comes from computer science and statistics respectively, while Robins comes from epidemiology, so it makes sense that I heard Pearl and Rubin's names more often.

The reason why I have returned to this text is because I've been working on panel data methods at work recently, and while a lot of the methods I became exposed to comes from econometrics (and quantitative political science), they've also been compared to methods like marginal structural models, which then helped me realize that I'm severely lacking in knowledge of Robin's work. 

For each chapter, I jot down some notes in Markdown on what I felt were the most important parts of the chapter. I try to keep it short each chapter because the longer they get, the higher chance that it just becomes more efficient to reference the text directly.
