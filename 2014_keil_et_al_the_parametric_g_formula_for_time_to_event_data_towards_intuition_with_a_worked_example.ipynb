        "Epidemiologists often use regression models (for example, Cox proportional hazards model) to adjust for confounding; this is equivalent to estimating stratum-specific hazard ratios and then averaging the information-weighted hazard ratios. When some of these confounders are also causal intermediates (i.e., mediator), this amounts to adjusting away some of the effects of exposure.\n",
        "\n",
        "The $g$-formula works differently: first, one finds weighted averages of the stratum-specific hazards, and then those averaged (standardized) hazards are combined in a summary hazard ratio. Thus, bias resulting from time-varying confounders that can be both confounders and causal intermediates is a shortcoming of using regression models to control for confounding, rather than a general principle of observational data analysis. The g-formula is a tool that overcomes this shortcomings, but its use in the literature has been sparse."
