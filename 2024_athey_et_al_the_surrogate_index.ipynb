        "\n",
        "A fundamental challenge for evaluating interventions is that the primary outcome of interest are often hard to measure. Researchers are often interested in the effect of the policy on some long-term outcome but do not observe that in their study. Instead, they observe a number of short-term outcomes that are all related to this primary outcome of interest.\n",
        "\n",
        "The researcher is faced with making recommendations regarding the future implementation of the intervention on the basis of measurements of its effect on a variety of sometimes disparate and possibly conflicting outcome measures. A key question is how to balance these different outcomes when making an overall assessment.\n",
        "\n",
        "This paper lays out a framework for analyzing these issues.\n",
        "\n",
        "Assumes you have two datasets. The first one, likely experimental. The second is an observational dataset where the researcher observes the surrogates and the primary outcome but does not observe treatment.\n",
        "\n",
        "The paper makes 4 main contributions:\n",
        "\n",
        "**First Contribution**:\n",
        "\n",
        "Articulates the 3 key assumptions under which the ATE on the primary outcome is identified from the combination of experimental and observational samples:\n",
        "- i. A standard assumption that the assignment in the experimental sample is *Unconfounded*\n",
        "- ii. a *Surrogacy* assumption which requires that the causal path from the treatment to the primary outcome goes through the surrogates\n",
        "- iii. a *Comparability* or external validity assumption, which requires that the observational and experimental samples are comparable in the sense that the outcome distributions conditional on surrogates and pre-treatment variables are identical.\n",
        "\n",
        "Under these 3 assumptions, the ATE on the primary outcome can be estimated as the ATE on an aggregate of surrogates, which we label the surrogate index. This index combines the individual surrogates through their predicted value of the primary outcome.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, when studying the impact of class size (the treatment), the primary outcome might be high school graduation, a lagging metric, and the two surrogates might be mathematics and reading scores.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Second Contribution**:\n",
        "\n",
        "Derive the efficiency bound and propose various efficient estimators under various scenarios, including scenarios with a single sample or two samples, as well as with and without Surrogacy. This allows us to quantify the information content of the Surrogacy assumption.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Third Contribution**:\n",
        "\n",
        "Provide bounds on the biases that arise in scenarios where either or both of Surrogacy or Comparability are violated. Show that even if these assumptions fail to hold (but unconfoundedness does hold), the proposed estimators still estimate a well-defined causal effect, by providing a principled way of combining short-term outcomes in a single measure through their predicted effect on the long-term outcome.\n",
