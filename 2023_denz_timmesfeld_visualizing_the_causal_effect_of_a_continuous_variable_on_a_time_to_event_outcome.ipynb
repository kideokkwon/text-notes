        "\n",
        "With a time-to-event endpoint, such as th time until recurrence of a disease or death, the most popular approach is to draw Kaplan-Meier survival curves, or confuonder-adjusted alternatives, for each group of interest. This, however, only works if there is a discrete number of groups. In reality, the variable of interest may be continuous, making the use of Kaplan-Meier survival curves impossible.\n",

The survival area plot directly extends the standard Kaplan-Meier plot to the continuous case by depicting the survival probability as a function of time and a continuous covariate through the use of a color-scaled area. We use g-computation to obtain the required probability estimates, allowing the plot to be adjusted for confuonders. Under the standard causal identifiability assumptions, the resulting survival probabilities can be interpreted as counterfactual quantities, resulting in a display of the causal effect of the continuous variable on the time-to-event outcome.\n",
