        "Something I felt while reading this paper is that similar to quite a bit of the other work of Pearl that I've read (such as his book \"The Book of Why\"), it feels noticeably distinct from other causal inference papers. While other papers I've read on observational causal inference has focused on a problem and solving it with causal inference methodology, Pearl's work focuses not on the methods but developing the mathematical *theory* on causation itself. He is focused on creating the language while letting other scholars apply the language to do meaningful causal inference. Another note (perhaps a little bit amusing) is that I have not read work by Pearl where he doesn't take jabs at least two entities - and it always includes Donald Rubin and \"traditional statisticians\".\n",
